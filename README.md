# Data 
The data table features Airbnb listings in Seattle from 2016, providing detailed information on various aspects such as pricing, room types, zip codes, revenue, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and more.

## Visualziations 1: Price Per Zipcode
The visualizations enable us to observe the average price per zip code in the Seattle area. I added the Zipcode field to the color mark to differentiate between zip codes on the graph, and organized the chart from highest to lowest price.

## Visualizations 2: Price per Zipcode Map
I also represented the average price per zip code on maps. I used color marks to distinguish between zip codes and label marks to display the zip code and average price directly on the map.

## Visualizations 3: 2016 Revenue
I visualized the weekly 2016 revenue using a line chart by placing the 'Date' field in the 'Columns' and selecting the 'Week Number' from the date data. I then placed the price in the 'Rows' section and chose the 'Average' measure to illustrate the average revenue per week.

## Visualzation 4: AVG Price Bedroom
I created a bar chart to display the average price based on the number of bedrooms. I placed the 'Bedrooms' field in the 'Columns' section and 'Price' in the 'Rows' section, selecting the 'Average' measure. Additionally, I used label marks to show the actual average price on the chart.
