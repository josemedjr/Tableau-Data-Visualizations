# Data 
The data table features Airbnb listings in Seattle from 2016, providing detailed information on various aspects such as pricing, room types, zip codes, revenue, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and more.

## Visualziations 1: Price Per Zipcode
The visualizations enable us to observe the average price per zip code in the Seattle area. I added the Zipcode field to the color mark to differentiate between zip codes on the graph, and organized the chart from highest to lowest price.
